## Information

This is the README.md file to our game "CobbleCock". It is a project that I, Nikita Schaar, and my friends 
Manuel Pirkmann and Janik Gierer are working on. We are working on it for our school's **POS** class and
don't completely know what we're doing, but we're trying our best.

### Resources used
Because we're making our game with Java, we're using a library that's intended for Game development, 
that's called Greenfoot. For the version control we're using Git/GitHub and the tool we use for making
game sprites is called Aseprite. The links to all these tools are below this text:

This is our temporary Start Screen, which we are going to change soon and just used for testing purposes.

This is the newest version of our gameplay as of today. It still looks quite unpolished and we'll have
to rework a lot of files, but the gameplay at least works and doesn't have any major bugs (right now :'])

This is how our item shop looks as of today. It has one buyable item for now, but as you can see, we're
working on five other upgrades already (maybe we'll make even more).
