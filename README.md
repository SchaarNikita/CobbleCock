## Information

This is the README.md file to our game "CobbleCock". It is a project that I, Nikita Schaar, and my friends 
Manuel Pirkmann and Janik Gierer are working on. We are working on it for our school's **POS** class and
don't completely know what we're doing, but we're trying our best.

### Resources used
Because we're making our game with Java, we're using a library that's intended for Game development, 
that's called Greenfoot. For the version control we're using Git/GitHub and the tool we use for making
game sprites is called Aseprite. The links to all these tools are below this text:
