## Information

This is the README.md file to our game "CobbleCock". It is a project that I, Nikita Schaar, and my friends 
Manuel Pirkmann, Janik Gierer, Nikola Maksic, Alexander Sch√ºller and Sebastian Katholnigg are working on. We are working on it for our school's **SEM** class.

<a name="resources"></a>
### Resources used
Because we're making our game with Java, we're using a library that's intended for Game development, 
that's called Greenfoot. For the version control we're using Git/GitHub and the tool we use for making
game sprites is called Aseprite. The links to all these tools are below this text:

- [Greenfoot](https://greenfoot.org/door)
- [GitHub](https://github.com/)
- [Aseprite](https://aseprite.com)

### Images
![Screenshot of the temporary start screen.](https://i.postimg.cc/MpMNkPS0/Start-Screen.png)

This is our temporary Start Screen, which we are going to change soon and just used for testing purposes.

![Screenshot of the gameplay.](https://i.postimg.cc/2Skdh3H1/Gameplay.png)

This is the newest version of our gameplay as of today. It still looks quite unpolished and we'll have
to rework a lot of files, but the gameplay at least works and doesn't have any major bugs ~~(right now)~~

![Screenshot of the item shop with one available item to buy.](https://postimg.cc/TpGkhQcx)
This is our current state of the shop where we have 2 buyable upgrades. Manuel Pirkmann is currently working on more upgrades. 

## Shop upgrade ideas
- Coin upg
- Haste upg
- Pickaxe upg (more cobblestone)
-
-
- Dungeon Upgrade

### Plans for the future
- Reduce data redundancy/Make files more compact/readable
	- Our "MyWorld.java" file looks like that right now and is just very barely readable (also only for us who are working on the project).
	```java
	import greenfoot.*; // (World, Actor, GreenfootImage, Greenfoot and MouseInfo)
	
	/**
	 * Write a description of class MyWorld here.
	 * 
	 * @author (your name) 
	 * @version (a version number or a date)
	 */
	public class MyWorld extends World
	{
	    
	    /**
	     * Constructor for objects of class MyWorld.
	     * 
	     */
	    public MyWorld()
	    {    
	        // Create a new world with 600x400 cells with a cell size of 1x1 pixels.
	        super(600, 400, 1);
	        GreenfootImage bg = new GreenfootImage("Background.png");
	        // bg.scale(960, 540);
	
	        // GreenfootSound gs = new GreenfootSound("Minecraft.mp3");
	        // gs.playLoop();
	
	        this.setBackground(bg);
	
	        //Cloud1 c1 = new Cloud1();
	
	        //this.addObject(c1, 300, 200);
	
	        LavaGen lg = new LavaGen();
	
	        this.addObject(lg, 515, 231);

	        this.addObject(steve, 100, 230);
	
	        SellPoint sp = new SellPoint(cobA, ca);
	
	        this.addObject(sp, 40, 255);
	
	        // Adds a Nametag which follows the player
	        Nametag nt = new Nametag(steve);
	
	        this.addObject(nt, 100, 177);
	
	        PickaxeStone sP = new PickaxeStone(steve);
	
	        this.addObject(sP, 40, 215);
	
	        // Adds a Shop which can be opened by pressing E
	        Shop shop = new Shop();
	
	        this.addObject(shop, 300, 200);
	
	        WaitCount waitC = new WaitCount();
	
	        this.addObject(waitC, 0, 0);
	
	        SellTent sT = new SellTent();
	
	        this.addObject(sT, 40, 215);
	
	        CoinUpgrade moreCoins = new CoinUpgrade(ca);
	
	        this.addObject(moreCoins, 246, 80);
	
	        CoinUpgradeText cUT = new CoinUpgradeText();
	
	        this.addObject(cUT, 332, 80);
	        prepare();
	    }
	    /**
	     * Prepare the world for the start of the program.
	     * That is: create the initial objects and add them to the world.
	     */
	    private void prepare()
	    {
	    }
	}
	```
	- Comment our code more
	- Implement a combat/dungeon system
	- Make the game window completely resizable (low priority)
   	- Animations for character
   	-
